# API-Project

This project aims to teach students how to use APIs effectively, perform a variety of tasks such as looking up data and creating charts with that data, and how to create an effective website that uses these APIs. I created a website that used an API from the Open Data from NYC (a COVID-19 data source) for my API project. With this data, I used an API chart visualizer to produce data on the cases and hospitalization cases from the COVID-19 data. I used a calendar that allowed users to input a date, and it would return 7 days of data. I learned how to create a calendar on a website and implement it on a website so that the data is retrieved from the API. I also learned how to use these APIs and process the data from them to be displayed well. It was a frustrating yet exciting and satisfying project. I learned a lot from this project, not just implementing ideas and concepts that I learned in class, but also learning more from outside sources.
