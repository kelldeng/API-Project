# API-Project

This project aims to teach students how to use APIs effectively, perform a variety of tasks such as looking up data and creating charts with that data, and how to create an effective website that uses these APIs. I created a website that used an API from the Open Data from NYC (a COVID-19 data source) for my API project, and used Chart.js to display graphs using the data from the API. As stated previously, I used an API chart visualizer to produce data on the cases and hospitalization cases from the COVID-19 data. I used a calendar that allowed users to input a date, and it would return 7 days of data. A calendar was implemented on the website so that the data is retrieved from the API. These APIs were chosen as COVID-19 cases are still a prominent topic in our society. The chart API was used to help with visualization for this topic from the COVID-19 API.
